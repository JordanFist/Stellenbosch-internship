CARCASSONNE
=============

Carcassonne is a board game for 2 to 5 players. The goal is to build a medieval landscape with tiles. On each turn a player draws a new terrain tile and places it adjacent to tiles that are already face up. The new tile must be placed in a way that extends features on the tiles it touches: roads must connect to roads, fields to fields, and cities to cities. 

After placing each new tile, the placing player may to station a meeple on a feature of that newly placed tile. The placing player may not use a meeple to claim any features of the tile that extend or connect features already claimed by another player.
